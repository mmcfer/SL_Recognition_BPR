# SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION based on BODY PARTS RELATIONS

Over the years, hand gesture recognition has been mostly addressed considering hand trajectories in isolation. However, in most sign languages, hand gestures are defined on a particular context (body region). We propose a pipeline which models hand movements in the context of other parts of the body captured in the 3D space using the Kinect sensor. In addition, we perform sign recognition based on the different hand postures that occur during a sign. Our experiments show that considering different body parts brings improved performance when compared with methods which only consider global hand trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate that the combination of hand postures features with hand gestures features helps to improve the prediction of a given sign.
